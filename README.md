## Running the website

Since this application is not a static application, you should have some thinks to do before you can start.

### Requirements

#### Node.js

If you don't have Node.js installed, just go to the following page and continue with the instructions: <a href="https://nodejs.org/es/download/"> Node.js WebSite </a>

#### MongoDB

Because you are going to run it locally, you should have install MongoDB. To install it just go to: <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community">MongoDB Community Server</a>

Once you have it installed, run:

```
mongod
```

So the local DB start and let you connect to it

### Important information

You need to create a
`.env`
File in root of the proyect, in this file you should add the
`DATABASE_URL=<yourDatabaseURL>`

For example `DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost/quenota`

It is also necesary to have access to de devolopers console of google, this is because this application use the Google's API to authenticate users. In the same `.env` file you should add your clientID and clientSectret:
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<yourClientId>`
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<yourClientSecret>`

The last think to add here is a secret command, you should just add:
`SECRET_OR_KEY=<secretWord>`

So the program will know where is the data base. If you have access to an Atlas Cluster you can add it also there, that information will never get into a repository at least you change de `.gitignore` file.

## Start

On the root folder of the proyect

```bash
# Install dependencies for client
yarn run client-install

# Install dependencies for server
yarn install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
yarn run dev

# Run the Express server only
yarn start

# Run the server with nodemon
yarn run server

# Run the React client only
yarn run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:3001 and client on http://localhost:3000
```
